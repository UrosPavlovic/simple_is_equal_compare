# simple_is_equal_compare
Compare two entities/values deeply, by checking types, lenght of keys / entries (if type is object like) and finally by value

Copy/paste isEqual.js file into your application and you are good to go. Tests are wrriten in jest, and they cover any usual comparation which you might wont to use.

Feel fee to contribute to this code if you find any flaws, and also feel free to add some more tests, especially compex ones.

This is good alternative for isEqual from lodash (_), which my original intension was to replase in my current project
